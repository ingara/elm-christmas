If you know how to write SVG, writing it in Elm is no different. You just type

```bash
elm install elm/svg
```

to install the [SVG module](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/elm-lang/svg/latest/). The syntax is a direct translation of regular SVG syntax. Whereas in regular SVG, you would write something like

```xml
<circle cx="50" cy="50" r="6" fill="yellow"/>
```

to draw a yellow circle at position `(50, 50)`, in Elm you would write:

```elm
Svg.circle
    [ cx "50"
    , cy "50"
    , r "6"
    , fill "yellow"
    ]
    []
```

The type signature is `List (Attribute msg) -> List (Svg msg) -> Svg msg`. So to get an SVG element, we pass in first a list of attributes (things like position, color, etc.) a list of child elements (which in this case is empty).

So how would one go about drawing for example a... christmas three?

## The base of the tree

Let us start with drawing the base:

```elm
width =
    "300"


height =
    "300"


main : Html.Html msg
main =
    svg
        [ Svg.Attributes.width width
        , Svg.Attributes.height height
        , Svg.Attributes.style "border: 1px solid black"
        , viewBox <| "0 0 " ++ width ++ " " ++ height
        ]
        [ Svg.defs []
            [ Svg.linearGradient [ Svg.Attributes.id "base" ]
                [ Svg.stop [ offset "0%", stopColor "brown" ] []
                , Svg.stop [ offset "100%" ] []
                ]
            ]

        -- BASE
        , Svg.polygon
            [ points <|
                polyPoints
                    [ ( 130, 250 )
                    , ( 170, 250 )
                    , ( 170, 300 )
                    , ( 130, 300 )
                    ]
            , fill "url(#base)"
            , stroke "black"
            ]
            []
        ]
```

This is maybe a lot at once: we first define the width and height of our viewbox, the "canvas" to put our figures in. Then we draw a rectangle placed in the middle bottom of the picture.

We fill the rectangle with a [nice gradient](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial/Gradients), going from brown to black. The result looks like this:

## Greanery

A good start! Let's add some greanery! A nice way to get a simple tree-ish feeling to the picture, is to stack a few green parallelogram on top of each other, and finish off with a triangle at the top. We do this with the following code:

```elm
        -- GREANERY
        , Svg.polygon
            [ points <|
                polyPoints
                    [ ( 50, 270 )
                    , ( 250, 270 )
                    , ( 200, 200 )
                    , ( 100, 200 )
                    ]
            , fill "url(#mygrad)"
            , stroke "black"
            ]
            []
        , Svg.polygon
            [ points <|
                polyPoints
                    [ ( 70, 230 )
                    , ( 230, 230 )
                    , ( 180, 150 )
                    , ( 120, 150 )
                    ]
            , fill "url(#mygrad)"
            , stroke "black"
            ]
            []
        , Svg.polygon
            [ points <|
                polyPoints
                    [ ( 90, 180 )
                    , ( 210, 180 )
                    , ( 150, 100 )
                    ]
            , fill "url(#mygrad)"
            , stroke "black"
            ]
            []
```

The `fill` attribute refers to the following, which is put inside a _SVG definitions node_, in Elm written `Svg.defs [] [...]`, with the definitions inside the dotted bracket.

```elm
                [ Svg.Attributes.id "mygrad"
                , x1 "0"
                , x2 "0"
                , y1 "0"
                , y2 "1"
                ]
                [ Svg.stop [ offset "0%", stopColor "green" ] []
                , Svg.stop [ offset "100%" ] []
                ]
```

The attributes `x1`, `x2`, `y1` and `y2` define the orientation of gradient. The points `(x1,y1)` and `(x2,y2)` define a vertical line along which the gradient changes. I have also written a helper function `polyPoints` which takes a list of tuples and turn them into string arguments that fit the SVG schema. This is how our tree looks now:

## Glowing lights

Looks like a tree at least! Let's add some Christmas spirit by adding a few glowing lights. To get a glowy effect for the lights, we use two SVG circles: one for the light itself, and one for the glow. The following function takes two coordinates and produces the correct SVG element.

```elm
light : Int -> Int -> Svg.Svg msg
light xx yy =
    Svg.g []
        [ Svg.circle
            [ cx <| String.fromInt xx
            , cy <| String.fromInt yy
            , r "6"
            , Svg.Attributes.filter "url(#glow)"
            , fill "yellow"
            ]
            []
        , Svg.circle
            [ cx <| String.fromInt xx
            , cy <| String.fromInt yy
            , r "3"
            , fill "yellow"
            ]
            []
        ]
```

Apply this function a few times to fill the tree with lights. We should also add a star! I chose to just use a simple polygon to keep the simplistic style.

Finally we end up with something looking like this:

It is admittedly not the most beautiful tree ever painted, but I think it gives us some ideas on what one can do with SVG.

Reading about SVG is fun, and I recommend reading the [MDN web docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/SVG/Tutorial). The tutorials are very good and friendly.
