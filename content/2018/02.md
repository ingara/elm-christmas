In this blog post we will examine different ways of getting your Elm app to run in the browser.
We will start with the simplest possible solution and work our way up to production-ready project scaffolding tools.

# elm make

```shell
$ elm make src/Main.elm
```

The simplest way of getting your Elm app to run in the browser is arguably just by using the compiler directly.
It takes one or more `.elm` files as input and outputs an `index.html` file that can be opened in the browser. This `.html` file will contain a `<script>` tag with the compiled JavaScript output of your Elm code.

See also

```shell
$ elm make --help
```

for more information on how to use `elm make`

# elm reactor

Running `elm make` each time you make a change to your code can quickly become tiresome. Therefore, `elm reactor` exists. If you run

```shell
$ elm reactor
```

in the directory where your code lives, it will start a small web server on [http://localhost:8000/]().
If you go to this page and navigate to your `.elm` file it will automatically compile your code and run it in your browser.
If you make changes to your code, all you have to do is reload your browser window to see the updated output.

# [elm-live](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live)

Not having to run the compiler manually for each change is pretty smooth, but what if we didn't even have to reload our browser window to see new changes?
Enter `elm-live`. `elm-live` is a more complete "dev server" that includes something called called "live reload" to achieve this.

If you give `elm-live` a `.elm` file it wil spin up a server (by default on [http://localhost:8000/]()) that recompiles your program and reloads the web page each time you change a file. Neat!

```shell
$ elm-live src/Main.elm
```

See [`elm-live`'s GitHub repo](https://github.com/wking-io/elm-live) for more information on what it can do.

# [create-elm-app](https://github.com/halfzebra/create-elm-app)

`create-elm-app` is an even more full-featured tool that is inspired by [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
With it you can quickly get a complete Elm application up and running in seconds.

Crash course:

```shell
$ npm install create-elm-app -g # installs create-elm-app globally
$ create-elm-app my-app # creates an Elm app in a folder called my-app
$ cd my-app/
```

This will create all the files you need for a complete Elm application.

Now you can run

```shell
elm-app start
```

to open your app in the browser.
As with `elm-live` it will recompile and reload your web browser when you change files!

`create-elm-app` will create a `README.md` file with more information on how to use it.

### Pro-tip

If you use this on a real-world project with multiple collaborators it might be a good idea to have a project-local installation of `create-elm-app` so that you don't have to rely on each team member having the same version installed.

To achieve this, do the following

```shell
$ npm init -y # creates a package.json file
$ npm install create-elm-app # adds create-elm-app as a local dependency
```

Then, open up `package.json` and change the `script` node to the following:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "elm-app start",
    "test": "elm-app test",
    "build": "elm-app build"
  },
```

Now when someone clones your repository, all the have to do is run `npm install` and `npm start` to install everything they need and run the application.

# Why is this so hard?

To better understand why we need to bind `this` in React, we should understand how `this` [works in JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md). Let's take a shot at it with the following snippet. 

```javascript
class Santa() {
  constructor() {
    this.catchphrase = "Ho ho ho ho!";
  }
  
  greet() {
    return this.catchphrase;
  }
}

const santa = new Santa();
console.log(santa.greet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
```

Awesome! That worked as expected, but will this?

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const greet = santa.greet;
console.log(greet()); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'catchphrase' of undefined

```

Wait, what!? We got a `TypeError` saying `catchphrase` isn't a property of `undefined`. Why is that?

In JavaScript, `this` is determined when a function is called, not when the function is defined. Moreover, `this` refers to the context of the function.

In the above example we create a new variable `greet`. `greet` is a top level variable so its context is `undefined`, and `undefined` does not have a property named `catchphrase`. Unlike `santa.greet` which has `santa` as its context, due to implicit binding. 

To better understand implicit binding, consider this example. 

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const greet = santa.greet;

const sheldon {
  catchphrase: "Bazinga!"
}

sheldon.greet = greet;
console.log(sheldon.greet()); // Bazinga!
```

Bazinga! This works because the `greet` function is called in the context of `sheldon`, which has a property named `catchphrase`.

## Binding it ourselves

Sometimes we might want to specify the context of a function. This can be achieved with the `bind` function, and is called explicit binding. 

```javascript
const santa = new Santa();
const badGreet = santa.greet;

const goodGreet = badGreet.bind(santa);
console.log(goodGreet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
console.log(badGreet()); // Uncaught TypeError: Cannot read property 'catchphrase' of undefined
```

Calling `bind` on a function returns a copy of the funciton with the argument as the context. In other words `this` is always whatever argument you pass to `bind` for that function. This even works if the implicit context is changed.

```javascript
sheldon.greet = goodGreet;
console.log(sheldon.greet()); // Ho ho ho ho!
```

## What about React?

Let's transform our example into a React component.

```jsx
class Santa extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {
      catchphrase: "Ho ho ho ho!"
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button 
        onClick={this.sayCatchphrase}
      >
        Say catchphrase
      </button>
    );
  }
  
  sayCatchphrase() {
    console.log(this.state.catchphrase);
  }
}
```

Clicking the button should ideally print `Ho ho ho ho!` to the console. However, it does **not** in the above example.

In the `sayCatchphrase` function `this` would be `undefined`. This is because the event handler function loses its implicitl binding. As mentioned previously, the context is determined when the function is called. When the event occurs and the function is invoked, the context falls back to the default binding and is set to `undefined`. 

To fix this we have a couple of options. We could bind the function ourselves: 

```jsx
<button 
  onClick={this.sayCatchphrase.bind(this)}
>
  Say catchphrase
</button>

```

> It is considered best practice to [avoid binding your functions in the render method.](https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-arrow-functions-and-bind-in-reacts-render-are-problematic-f1c08b060e36)


We can use an [arrow function](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions). This works because `this` is bound [lexically](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/blob/master/this%20%26%20object%20prototypes/ch2.md#lexical-this). This means that it uses the context of the `render` method as its context.

```jsx
<button 
  onClick={() => this.sayCatchphrase()}
>
  Say catchphrase
</button>
```

Or we can use the [public class field syntax](https://babeljs.io/docs/en/babel-plugin-proposal-class-properties), which is still experimental and a babel plugin is required to use it. 


```jsx
class Santa extends React.Component {
  constructor(props){
    super(props);
    
    this.state = {
      catchphrase: "Ho ho ho ho!"
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <button 
        onClick={this.sayCatchphrase}
      >
        Say catchphrase
      </button>
    );
  }
  
  sayCatchphrase = () => {
    console.log(this.state.catchphrase);
  }
}
```

That's it!
